# Discord Zendesk Darkmode [![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thereatra/Discord-Zendesk-Darkmode/master/zendesk-dark.user.css)

A dark theme for Discord's Zendesk pages. It's easier on the eyes and generally adheres better to Discord's design principles.  

<br>

## Initial goal

The goal of this repository is to both merge the [Discord Feedback Dark](https://userstyles.org/styles/165795) & [Discord Support Dark](https://userstyles.org/styles/166961) themes and to move them to a centralized location, this will in turn provide a way for users to more easily modify and share improvements of the themes. This also means that the themes on Userstyles.org will not receive any further updates.
