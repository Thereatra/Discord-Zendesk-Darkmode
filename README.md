# Discord Zendesk Darkmode

A dark theme for Discord's Zendesk pages. It's easier on the eyes and generally adheres better to Discord's design principles.

## Initial goal

The goal of this repository is to both merge and move the [Discord Feedback Dark](https://userstyles.org/styles/165795) & [Discord Support Dark](https://userstyles.org/styles/166961) themes to a centralized location, and to provide a way for users to modify and add to the themes, should it be needed. This also means that the themes on Userstyles.org will not receive any further updates.

## Preview
