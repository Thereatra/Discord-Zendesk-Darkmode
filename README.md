# Discord Zendesk Darkmode [![Install](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thereatra/Discord-Zendesk-Darkmode/master/zendesk-dark.user.css)

A dark theme for Discord's Zendesk pages. It is easier on the eyes and generally adheres better to Discord's design principles.

This repository started out as a merge of the [Discord Feedback Dark](https://userstyles.org/styles/165795) and [Discord Support Dark](https://userstyles.org/styles/166961) themes. This also means that those themes will not receive any updates.  
Additionally, this move provides a way for users to more easily modify and share improvements for the theme.
